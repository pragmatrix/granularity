This experiment is a shallow dive into incremental computation. It implements a very basic, though somewhat usable automatic dependency tracking, invalidation, and recomputation system. `lib.rs`'s test cases show off a basic example on how to use it.

This implementation uses a pull / on-demand based "naive" approach for the simple reason that push-based approaches seem to be [a lot more complicated](https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/seven-implementations-of-incremental/) and even [semantically incorrect](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/issues/41#issuecomment-589412839).

A on-demand approach like in this repository suffers from too much unnecessary invalidation and re-computation and therefore needs memoization to be efficient.
